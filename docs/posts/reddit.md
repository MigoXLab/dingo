[OC] Comprehensive AI Data Quality Metrics Documentation - 50+ Evaluation Metrics with Academic Sources

We've just released what might be the most comprehensive documentation of AI data quality evaluation metrics available. This covers everything from pre-training data assessment to multimodal evaluation.

**What's included:**
- 50+ evaluation metrics across text, image, and multimodal data
- Academic citations for every metric (RedPajama, CLIP, NIMA, etc.)
- Rule-based and LLM-based evaluation approaches
- Practical usage examples and API documentation

**Key categories:**
- Text Quality: Completeness, Fluency, Relevance, Effectiveness
- Image Quality: Clarity, Similarity, Validity
- Security: Political sensitivity, prohibited content, harmful information
- Classification: Topic categorization, content classification

This is particularly useful for:
- Data scientists working on model training
- Researchers needing standardized evaluation frameworks
- Anyone dealing with large-scale data quality assessment

The documentation includes detailed academic references and practical implementation examples. All open source and ready to use.

[P] Comprehensive AI Data Quality Metrics Documentation - 50+ Evaluation Metrics with Academic Sources for Dingo Framework

Hey r/MachineLearning!

We've just released comprehensive documentation for AI data quality evaluation metrics in our open-source framework **Dingo**. This covers everything from pre-training data assessment to multimodal evaluation.

**Project Overview:**
Dingo is an enterprise-grade data quality assessment tool designed for large-scale AI training pipelines.

**What's included in the metrics documentation:**
- 50+ evaluation metrics across text, image, and multimodal data
- Academic citations for every metric (RedPajama, CLIP, NIMA, etc.)
- Rule-based and LLM-based evaluation approaches
- Practical usage examples and API documentation

**Key metric categories:**
- **Text Quality**: Completeness, Fluency, Relevance, Effectiveness
- **Image Quality**: Clarity, Similarity, Validity
- **Security Assessment**: Political sensitivity, prohibited content detection
- **SFT Evaluation**: 3H principles (Honest, Helpful, Harmless)

**Technical features:**
- Multi-source support (HuggingFace, local files, S3)
- Distributed processing with Spark integration
- CLI/SDK/Web interfaces
- Comprehensive evaluation reports

This is particularly useful for:
- Data scientists working on model training pipelines
- Researchers needing standardized evaluation frameworks
- MLOps teams implementing data quality gates
- Anyone dealing with large-scale data preprocessing

**Documentation:** https://github.com/MigoXLab/dingo/blob/dev/docs/metrics.md
**Project repo:** https://github.com/MigoXLab/dingo

Would love to get feedback from the community! What data quality metrics do you find most valuable in your work?
